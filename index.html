                <p>My latest project has been such an amazing ride, I have always enjoyed coding in vanilla languages and just building it all from the ground up. In fact, this website is indeed done with all of the simple languages. Pretty cool huh. üî•</p>
                <p>I've dived into a lot of different libraries over the course of the past couple months, mainly react and angular but I've been kind of enjoying Vue way more than those. I know React is the most popular one..</p>
                <p>A lot of projects young bloods like myself tend to do are tons of different variations of different ideas. I however; have a plan to show off this mass of library knowledge I've acquired and the brillance of good architecture. My latest project: PAYD, will be done up in 3 different libraries. Only after I've completed the vanilla JS version, I will time how long it takes me to convert them to new libraries. Exciting? Heck ya it is.</p>

                <h2 class="contentTitle">Moving Over to TypeScript for YOU</h2>
                <p>I will be slowly implementing the use of TypeScript in all my future projects just because I get why people would want to use it, but I can sense the hatred of JS mainly because so many different libraries are used and updated breaking everything, I guess they would say "well you've never worked on larger projects" Ok. So to future proof myself, I am learning everything. I mean why not? Seeing a taste of everything out there isn't that hard, using it everyday could be different but I find learning new programming languages really easy, so I'm going to keep cruising until something breaks me. Too confident? We will see.. I'll be honest if anything ever does.</p>

                <p>Talking with a friend, learning that companies will go through so much effort to prevent people from using their APIs but then include their API key within the request where anyone who would want to use the API could see.

                <h2 class="contentTitle">PAYD App & mySQL / Node.Js</h2>
                <p>I'll be honest, I can't figure out why my modules in node.js aren't working with mysql imports, so I have to do some deep research to figure out if I'm just messing something really simple up or if I need to be creating a whole new library from scratch, typical stuff.</p>
                <p>On the otherside of things, my bill tracker app is coming along very nicely. Because of the nature of how it is being built, I plan to simple export this to two different JavaScript libraries and work with whichever one I like more: React or Angular. Everything being based out of the config file means that all of the data can be easily changed in seconds, as opposed to rewriting all of the code by moving frameworks.</p>
                <p>Heck ya. The website app isn't much so don't be too impressed but if you're interested in the code architecture, check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/ptnoire/PAYD-bill-tracker" style="color: rgb(255, 190, 190)">Link</a></p>

                <h2 class="contentTitle">mySQL & Node.js</h2>
                <p>So I've recently begun my dive into some databases, just picked mysql because of popularity. I enjoy working with node.js a lot and know that there is a good way to connect the two (mysql & node) so I've begun (without searching for an alternative, only for learning purposes) to develop a framework to easily communicate JS (node) with mysql databases and I have to say. It's pretty cool. To not just abandon the project I'm not going to search for what is out there just yet, but once I feel like it's off the developmental concrete floor, I'll open it up and see how I can actually implement it for more people. As always data is addictive.</p>

                <h2 class="contentTitle">Update DOM Algorithm</h2>
                <p>I've learned a lot over the past couple months when it comes to DOM manipulation. This was the first time I'd ever used a few of these built in features and done something that cuts down the memory usage of the website when updating elements on the page.</p><br>
                <p>Long story short (which I want to go in-depth but won't here) createRange() .createContextualFragment() is creating a virtual DOM so that I can compare the nodes to the current DOM, then using a conditional statement we will change the text content only if the node has a value of textcontent [nodeValue], then just below I'm specifically updating a dataset attribute used to modify the page's values from another feature. Do you think this is cool? I think in a large scale application it maybe a bit much but for this specific project is was really fancy.</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
    update(data) {
        this.data = data;
        const newMarkup = this._generateMarkup(data);
        const newDOM = document.createRange().createContextualFragment(newMarkup);
        const newElements = Array.from(newDOM.querySelectorAll('*'));
        const curElements = Array.from(this._parentElement.querySelectorAll('*'));
        newElements.forEach((newEl, i) => {
            const curEl = curElements[i];
            if(!newEl.isEqualNode(curEl) && newEl.firstChild?.nodeValue.trim() !== '') {
                curEl.textContent = newEl.textContent;
            };
            if(!newEl.isEqualNode(curEl)) {
                Array.from(newEl.attributes).forEach(attr => curEl.setAttribute(attr.name, attr.value));
            }
        })
