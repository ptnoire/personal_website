# personal_website
[Work in progress] This will eventually be my final client facing website, it will be the best way to get to know and hire me. I'm opting to build this in the public eye as I finish it just incase anyone decides to give criticism before it launches publically.

Features:
- Personal Blog which I will be coding the server-side app I'm developing to maintain this website (plan to launch something more public for people to use later)
- GitHub API usage for displaying my activity live under a projects section
- Better about me section, IMGs and kbs man, working on this + the formatting.
- Complete responsiveness for browser, mobile and tablet (horizontal)
- DESIGN. I want my work to speak volumes about me, the design will be the focus for the user to enjoy the site.

Jan 30th 2023 - Site is at a skeleton stage, I've given this a week of thought on design mostly but since I can't nail the design just yet I am implementing a lot of the features I want to showcase on the site. Ignore the about me section with the blue squares (try clicking them rofl)
